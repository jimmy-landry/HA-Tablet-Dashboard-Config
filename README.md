# HA-Tablet-Dashboard-Config

>[!NOTE]
>**Under construction**! <br>
>Hi everyone! Glad you're still enjoying this dashboard! For the next little while new files will be popping in and out of this repo due to a new video I'm in the process of making. Don't worry about them, you don't need them for the dashboard as it is now. However, if you're curious what they're all about, make sure you [subscribe to my channel](https://youtube.com/@dontuseiftamperevident?sub_confirmation=1) so you don't miss the new videos.

>In the meantime, the "wall_tablet_grid_redacted.yaml" file is now named "Original Dashboard Config" and the "theme.yaml" file is now named "Original Dashboard Theme.yaml."

>Stay tuned! ðŸ˜„

Running HA OS on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. Using an Amazon Fire HD 10 running Android WallPanel for the dashboard.

## You'll need the following custom repos:
_All these are available in HACS._

------------------------------------

**Credit where credit is due:**
The layout of the dashboard was heavily inspired by matt8707's tablet dashboard, which you can find here: https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config. I reused some of the button-card templates, replaced the sidebar with a vertical-stack-in-card, and deleted the custom icon config so I could use the built-in MDI icons.

I'm sure there's probably code in there I don't need, as the actual card config doesn't even start until line 2696 ðŸ˜‚... however it's been working great for me for more than 6 months now, so I haven't seen a reason to waste time removing it.

It's not necessary, but I recommend enabling the theme.yaml file on your tablet, as I designed this dashboard with that theme in mind. It's a smattering of stock HA, UI-Lovelace-Minimalist, and matt8707's theme, so it's a total mess too, but should work just fine.

## Enabling the themes folder

If you don't have them already, add the following lines to your configuration.yaml to enable the themes folder:

```
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
```

This ensures that Home Assistant knows where to find your custom themes.

## Removing the box-shadow element for the sidebar

Sometimes a shadow will appear under the cards in the sidebar despite them being positioned inside a card that's supposed to remove them. Here's an example from my mobile dashboard:

<img width="766" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 7 25 04â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/jimmy-landry/HA-Tablet-Dashboard-Config/assets/121106900/5f0879f6-79d5-4b21-8cba-3727b7f5626c">

I have no idea what causes this. If you're seeing something along these lines, don't worry, you can use card-mod to remove the shadow manually. Put this code below the card config (you may have to click show code editor first):

```
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      box-shadow: none
    }
```

## Date and time template sensors

As mentioned in the video, I use some custom template sensors to return the day of the week and 12 hour time for usage at the top of the sidebar. To get these working on your instance, add the following code to your configuration.yaml:

```
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
```

### Then add any of the below sensors within the "sensors" key:

**12 hour time sensor:**
```
timenew:
  friendly_name: "XTime"
  value_template: >
    {% set time = states('sensor.time') %}
    {% set hour = time[:2]|int %}
    {% set timenew = '{:2d}:{}'.format(hour if hour == 12 else hour % 12, time[3:5]) %}
    {% set hournew = timenew[:2]|int %}
    {% set hournew2 = (hournew + 12 if hournew == 0 else hournew) %}
    {{ '{:2d}:{} {}'.format(hournew2 if hournew2 == 12 else hournew % 12, timenew[3:5], 'PM' if hour>11 else 'AM') }}
```

**Day of the week sensor:**

```
weekday:
  friendly_name: Weekday
  value_template: >
    {% set weekday = now().weekday() %} 
    {% if (weekday == 0) %} Monday 
    {% elif (weekday == 1) %} Tuesday 
    {% elif (weekday == 2) %} Wednesday
    {% elif (weekday == 3) %} Thursday 
    {% elif (weekday == 4) %} Friday
    {% elif (weekday == 5) %} Saturday 
    {% elif (weekday == 6) %} Sunday
    {% endif %}
```

**Month of the year sensor:**

```
month:
  friendly_name: Month
  value_template: >
    {% set weekday = now().month %} 
    {% if (weekday == 1) %} January 
    {% elif (weekday == 2) %} February 
    {% elif (weekday == 3) %} March 
    {% elif (weekday == 4) %} April  
    {% elif (weekday == 5) %} May
    {% elif (weekday == 6) %} June 
    {% elif (weekday == 7) %} July 
    {% elif (weekday == 8) %} August 
    {% elif (weekday == 9) %} September 
    {% elif (weekday == 10) %} October 
    {% elif (weekday == 11) %} November 
    {% elif (weekday == 12) %} December 
    {% endif %}
```
