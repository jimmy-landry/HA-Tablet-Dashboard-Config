## There are currently two dashboards available for you to use:

**The all-new frosted glass dashboard**, which is a major re-style of the original tablet dashboard I released last March. 

**The original dashboard** that blew up on YouTube last year. Seriously, the response to that video was _insane_ and I'm so grateful that so many people found it useful. For this reason, this dashboard is going to remain available to you for the forseeable future.
